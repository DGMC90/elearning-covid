## Kaggle Project Title: LearnPlatform COVID-19 Impact on Digital Learning

This is described as an <strong><u>analytics competition</u></strong>.

### Overarching goals of research
1) Explore the state of digital learning in 2020. 
2) Explore how engagement of digital learning relates to factors such as distinct demographics, broadband access, and state/national level policies and events.

### Example questions from brief
- What is the picture of digital connectivity and engagement in 2020?
- What is the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on online and distance learning, and how might this also evolve in the future?
- How does student engagement with different types of education tech change over the course of the pandemic?
- Thinking intersectionally, how does student engagement with online learning platforms relate to different:
    - geography?
    - Demographic context (e.g. race/ethnicity, ESL, learning disabilities)?
    - Learning context?
    - Socioeconomic status?
- Do certain state interventions, practices, or policies (e.g. stimulus money, reopening, eviction moratoriums) correlate with increased or decreased engagement?
